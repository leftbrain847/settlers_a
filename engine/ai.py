"""
AI player strategies.

Each strategy is a function that takes (engine, player_id) and returns
an Action to perform. The engine doesn't care if an action comes from
a human or an AI — it's all the same.

To create a custom AI: define a function with the same signature.
The AIStrategy base class is designed to be subclassed — including
by future RL-trained agents that learn from self-play.
